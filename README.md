## Goal for step1 and 2:
Step 1:  Setup your REACT Native Environment</br>
Step 2:  Go through REACT native Tutorial</br>
* Build Hello Applications</br>
* Run Hello applications on emulator and your phone.</br>
* It will be great to run it on two phones if you can (iOS and Android)</br>



## Result of step 1 and 2:
I changed the Hello Application a little bit.</br>
Add a button to it, press the button to change the text.</br>
Because I do not habve a Android phone, so I run on two emulator(Android and iOS)</br>
