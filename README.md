# codvid-app-bdjbray


## Goal
Use CODVID-19 API (Documentation using postman) to build mobile application that displays:</br>
* CODVID cases per country on a MAP</br>
* CODVID cases per country Live on a MAP (changes)</br>
* CODVID cases per country based on a date.</br>
* Summary of total cases for the world</br>
* Live Summary for the World</br>
## Stretch goal:
* Display data per Province</br>
* User can put their address and track CODVID-19 in their neighborhood (Only in countries where regional data is provided)</br>

## Goal for Step1 and 2:
Step 1:  Setup your REACT Native Environment</br>
Step 2:  Go through REACT native Tutorial</br>
* Build Hello Applications</br>
* Run Hello applications on emulator and your phone.</br>
* It will be great to run it on two phones if you can (iOS and Android)</br>



## Result of Step 1 and 2:
I changed the Hello Application a little bit.</br>
Add a button to it, press the button to change the text.</br>
Because I do not habve a Android phone, so I run on two emulator(Android and iOS)</br>
Before changing the text:</br>

## Goal for Step 3:
Develop use case to display a map.</br>

## Result of Step 3:
I used react native and react native maps to build a simple app.</br>
I chose times square as the initial location and put a marker there.</br>
Because I don't have an Android phone, so I used an iOS emulator and an Android emulator for demo.</br>

## Goal for Step 4
On separate branch, exercise the CODVID-19 API (Documentation using postman) and display the data in your application as text. 

## Result of Step 4
Because I don't have an Android phone, so I used two simulator for test.</br>
